    "abstract": "Detained' is an absorbing observation from within the walls of a Swedish immigration detention center for rejected asylum seekers. The film follows detainees and staff over the course of one summer. A mother separated from her sons faces deportation, a young man waits for his life to begin, and staff members struggle with the impersonal code of conduct required of their job. With great sensibility to its characters and environment, 'Detained' depicts the silent psychological horror faced by those held in modern detention centers and questions this crucial, global phenomenon.",

Even in its incomplete form, the film was immensely powerful, generating an awed hush among audiences. But now, complete to six reels, this faithfully restored and definitive version produced by the Imperial War Museums and with a newly recorded narration by actor Jasper Britton, has been rightfully compared with Alain Resnais' Night and Fog (1955).",

The film combined autobiographical narrative thread involving the history of the filmmaker\u00b4s family and a historical narrative about migration that spans the globe. But before you know it, the spirit materializes, observes the filmmaker, energizes the story\u00b4s images, and affects the present. In the form of a shadow it flits through the garden and comments on the complex connections between past and present as a figure in a shadow theater.",

In harsh contrast to her goal is the plan of her family, strongly advanced by her mother, to make her a bride and sell her to a new family. The price for her hand right now is about US $9,000. What\u2019s more, women aren't allowed to sing in Iran. How can Sonita still succeed in making her dreams come true? Director Rokhsareh Ghaem Maghami ends up personally involved in answering that question, reigniting the discussion as to how documentary makers should relate to their subjects.",
